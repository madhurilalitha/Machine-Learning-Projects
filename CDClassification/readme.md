This project provides initial analysis on the bank-client dataset provided. Out of given datasets, the "bank-additional.csv" dataset is used for the analysis purpose and to come up with the best predetive model

Ground Truth: Sales team should find a model that identifies the customer who buys the CD. Therefore, the concentration will be more on the label "yes"("1" here) to obtain maximum F-1 score on this label.

Note: Due to the size of the dataset, I am still working on the gridsearch technique, to optimize the selected model. Will update optimized results very soon.
